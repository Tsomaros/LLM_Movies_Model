# Progress

## Now
- Phase 1 plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-05-phase1-foundation-and-data.md`. Task 1 done. Next: Task 2 (money conversion).
- Execution: subagent-driven, alternating between Claude Code (Windows) and the claude.ai cloud session.
- No GitHub remote yet, so `.github/workflows/ci.yml` has not run. Check the first run after the first push.

## Done
- 2026-11-05: Design spec approved; roadmap and Phase 1 plan written; `CLAUDE.md`, the three subagents (adapted) and the
  ponytail skill copied from the Movie Prediction App.
- 2026-11-05: Task 1 (repo foundation, config, CI). 7 tests pass, ruff clean, code-reviewer and test-auditor run on Windows.

## Open questions
- `min_votes` for the score target: decided from the Phase 1 data report.
- Base model and its training cutoff: decided in Phase 2.

## Notes
- Reviews run on the cloud side are marked "(cloud review, no hooks)".
- `tests/test_config.py` pins `config/data.yaml` to the defaults (`min_votes` 50, `base_model_cutoff` null). Changing either
  value (Task 15 Step 5, Phase 2) turns `test_defaults_match_spec` and `test_yaml_and_dataclass_defaults_agree` red, so those
  tests must change with the decision.
- Layout decisions in Task 1: flat `llm_movies/` at the repo root (`module-root = ""`), `requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.12"`,
  no `paths` key in `config/data.yaml` until a task needs one.
